## Introducing ComDash
Last year our startup announced Comdash: an all-in-one web-based Dashboard to get essential day-to-day information for users built using Html5 for frontend structure, CSS3 for webpage styling and JavaScript for background infomation retreival processes.  
So what does ComDash do? Well ComDash can retrieve news, weather, tasks and some more cool features coming soon.

ComDash is currently still under development so stay tuned to latest updates and 'star' and 'watch' this repository. 


## Running ComDash
To run ComDash all you'll need to do is to open ComDash.html file in your browser.


## What Are The APIs should I subscribe to?
Upon opening, by default you can reteive news and weather using pre-existing APIs but if you want it personalised then it is best to activate the API. To do that you will need to head to:

1. https://newsapi.org/ : For Live News, Morning Briefings and News Headlines.

2. https://openweathermap.org/ : For current Weather information.

Both websites once registered will provide you an API key, Users should then copy the API key and paste it in Javascript code.


## Issues
As this project is still in development and testing stage, if you run into any issues while operating or have any suggestions or features, please feel free to drop by our [issues](https://github.com/Epicalable/ComDash/issues) section and open a issue and we'll respond within 2 working days.
