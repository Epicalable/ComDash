## Introducing ComDash
Comdash is an all-in-one web-based Dashboard to get essential day-to-day information such as current weather, weather forecast, global news headlines and store To-do tasks for users. This product is built primarily using React JS as the frontend framework and Firebase as the backend database to store and retrieve user's information.

```
Once the command is executed you will get the following output. You will need to go to the localhost link (here is is http://localhost:5173/) or you can press ctrl + click on the link.

  ➜  press h + enter to show help
```

## What APIs Should I Subscribe To?
Upon opening, by default you can track your To-Do tasks so it is best to activate an API. Users should then copy the API key and paste it in the respective input-bars present in the settings page (accessible through the taskbar on the left side). 

To do that users will need to head to and register for the following API services :

1. https://openweathermap.org/ : For ComDash to get current weather information and weather forecast for your city and display in WeatherCard.

2. https://gnews.io/ : For ComDash to get current news headlines for your country (chosen in the drop-down list) and display it for you in the NewsCard.   
   <img width="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bf297798-f784-4cfc-a90c-13a5267fcc69"> <img width="150" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a5a57409-bdce-465c-9278-633869cfcabe"> 

3. https://unsplash.com/developers : For ComDash to get a random background image which is based on your city.

   #### Where Do I Paste The APIs?

   Users should then copy the API key and paste it in the respective input-bars present in the settings page (accessible through the taskbar on the left side).


## How Your Data Is Handled With Firebase?
In ComDash only your Api-keys and your To-Do tasks are saved in the database for easy retrieval. All these information are saved under the E-Mail address which is used for registering in the login page at the start.

   #### For Devs Who Want To Have A Private Firebase Database
   For Devs who want to have a private database without storing your info on our databases you can go to [Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/) and create a project followed by adding an app.  
   Then copy the Api keys and other Project keys provided once successful registeration of the app and paste it in the .env file

   ```
   VITE_API_KEY={your api key}
   VITE_AUTH_DOMAIN={your auth domain}
   VITE_PROJECT_ID={your project id}
   VITE_STORAGE_BUCKET={your storage bucket}
   VITE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID={your sender id}
   VITE_APP_ID={your app id}
   ```
   Enter the following code snippet in your "Rules" section of the Firestore Database.
   ```
   service cloud.firestore {
      match /databases/{database}/documents {
         match /users/{userId}/{document=**} {
         allow read, write: if request.auth != null && request.auth.uid == userId;
         }
      }
   }
   ```



## Other Functions Available
Apart from APIs to retreive information ComDash also comes with some more functionalities for users to use:-
1. Tasks-Tracker:
