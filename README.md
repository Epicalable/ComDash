## Introducing ComDash
Last year our startup announced Comdash: an all-in-one web-based Dashboard to get essential day-to-day information for users built using Html5 for frontend structure, CSS3 for webpage styling and JavaScript for background infomation retreival processes.  
So what does ComDash do? Well ComDash can retrieve news, weather, tasks and some more cool features coming soon.

ComDash is currently still under development so stay tuned to latest updates and 'star' and 'watch' this repository. 


## Running ComDash
To run ComDash all you'll need to do is to open ComDash.html file in your browser.


## What APIs should I subscribe to?
Upon opening, by default you can reteive news and weather using pre-existing APIs but if you want it to be personalised then it is best to activate an API. To do that you will need to head to:

1. https://newsapi.org/ : For ComDash To Get Current News Headlines For You And Display In NewsCard.
